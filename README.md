## 1. What is Lite.IM?

Lite.IM is a full-featured, conversational cryptocurrency wallet built for use with SMS and instant messaging apps. Users can signup and create their wallet, send and receive cryptocurrency, and check their balance and transaction history, all with a simple set of commands.

Currently, Lite.IM supports Telegram, Facebook Messenger, as well as SMS messaging for U.S. and Canadian phone numbers, with additional app and country support coming soon. Cryptocurrencies currently supported are BTC, LTC, ETH, and ZTX.

Lite.IM is a project from the [Zulu Republic](https://www.zulurepublic.io/) team. 

## 2. Technology

**Architecture**

Lite.IM is lightweight, yet robust. Lite.IM is built to be scalable, highly available, and most importantly, secure. We are using industry leading services to assure the highest level of quality and peace of mind. 

**Private Keys**

Security is at the forefront of our services. Users' private keys are RSA encrypted using the user's password. Only the encrypted value is stored, which can only be decrypted using the user's password. We do not store passwords of any sort, authentication tokens of any sort, nor do we ever store an unencrypted version of a user's sensitive data, so users' funds are secure even if our servers are compromised.

    - US/CAN: +1-760-LITEIM-0 (+1-760-548-3460)

## 4. How does it work?

User onboarding takes place directly within the bot's chat environment. Users are prompted to register with an email address and password, and to enable two-factor authentication with a mobile phone number. Upon successful registration and confirmation of the received 2FA code, the user's wallet is ready to use. 

By following simple prompts from the bot, users can then send and receive cryptocurrency, reveal their balance, and view their recent transaction history. 

When using the send command, users can send cryptocurrency to either a valid wallet address or to an email address if the recipient is already registered with Lite.IM. 

The receive command allows users to reveal their wallet address and/or the email address that they registered with. 

Additional functionality will be added with future updates.
